Exercise Answers to Sam Tech Yourself SQL Book (6th Edition)

For those of you who are reading and completing the book exercises, I have provided this repository of exercise answers to help you compare your code with mine.
Although the back of the book does provide answers, sometimes they're missing, incomplete, or mixed up with other exercises.

I hope you find this resource helpful and good luck in your journey in learning SQL.
